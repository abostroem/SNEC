This directory contains the following model profiles for test runs of SNEC:

* The profiles 'sedov.short' and 'sedov.iso.dat' are to be used for the Sedov blastwave test (see description in the notes to the code). They represent a sphere of radius R = 2 cm and constant density ρ0 = 1 g cm−3, consisting of neutrons.

* The profiles '15Msol_RSG.short' and '15Msol_RSG.iso.dat' represent a red supergiant, obtained with the stellar evolution code MESA from a 15 solar mass zero-age main sequence star.

* The profiles 'stripped_star.short' and 'stripped_star.iso.dat' represent a star generated from a 15 solar mass zero-age main sequence star using MESA, with the convective envelope stripped during the evolution (for details, see Piro & Morozova, ApJ, 792, L11 (2014)).
